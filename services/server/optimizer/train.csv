"Can I schedule a future transfer?","Yes, you can schedule a transfer for a future date. In the transfer screen, choose 'Schedule' and select the desired date. The transfer will be automatically processed on that day."
"Why is my transfer still pending after 3 days?","Transfers may remain pending if the receiving bank is taking longer to process the ACH request, or if additional security checks are triggered. If a transfer is pending beyond 3 business days, contact support with the transaction ID for investigation."
